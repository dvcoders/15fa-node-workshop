# node-workshop

Lets learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)! Node.js is a JavaScript framework to **create** and **run** servers using JavaSccript syntax! That means we can make HTTP servers using JavaScript as the backend langauge - pretty awesome right?

There's a lot to learn in Node, but we're going to apply the fundamentals of Server/Client design to our workshops.


### [Node Todo List](/node-todo-list)

Remember our workshop on front-end JavaScript and DOM manipulation ([todo.js](https://github.com/dvcoders/intro-js/tree/master/1-beginner-js))? We made simple front-end todo-list app using JavaScript.

We're going to adapt that todo.js app to have a Client (browser) and Server (Node.js).

1. You should clone this repoistory if you have not done so already.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/dvcoders/node-workshop.git`
  
2. If you **already** worked on the Intro Node workshop from last week
  
  `$ cd node-workshop`
  
  `$ git pull origin master`
  
Your directory will now be up to date: we'll be working in the `node-todo-list/` directory.
